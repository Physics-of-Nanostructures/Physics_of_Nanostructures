# Physics_of_Nanostructures
A general-purpose repository for the research group Physics of Nanostructures (FNA) of the Eindhoven University of Technology. 
This repository contains a collection of tools written in Python and Matlab and a wiki containing some general recipes and procedures.

## Structure
### Python
The Python tools are bundled in a Python package named "fnatools" that can be installed as a whole.
